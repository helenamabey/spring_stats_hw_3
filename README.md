Homework 4
Part One linear regression
Question 1
Read two “Important self reading” pdf files about linear regression assumptions and answer the following questions.
What’re assumptions of linear regression? How do you perform the diagnosis analysis of assumptions? If there are violations of each assumption, what’re the right ways to overcome the violations?

Question 2
Let’s take a look at the Real_estate.csv data.
 
You are a data analyst at a real estate consultancy firm tasked with uncovering market trends and providing insights to help clients make informed investment decisions in the real estate market. Your analysis focuses on understanding how various factors such as location, age of the property, and accessibility to amenities like MRT stations and convenience stores affect property values. The goal is to identify key drivers of real estate prices and predict future trends to advise on potential investment opportunities. 
Now please answer the questions below: 
1.	Does the age of a house significantly impact its price per unit area? Please answer this question by generating and interpreting all appropriate non-graphical and graphical EDAs. 
2.	How does the distance to the nearest MRT station affect the house price? Is closer proximity associated with higher prices? Please answer these questions by generating and interpreting all appropriate non-graphical and graphical EDAs. 
3.	Are properties with a higher number of nearby convenience stores priced higher than those with fewer? Please answer these questions by generating and interpreting all appropriate non-graphical and graphical EDAs. 
4.	Please develop a simple linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its age. Before implementing the regression analysis, partition your data such that 70% of the observations are in the training set and 30% of the observations are in the test set. 
5.	Please provide the regression function in a form of Y= a+bX. Please interpret the intercept and the slope. What do these values tell you about how house age affects price? 
6.	At the 0.05 level of significance, , is there evidence of the slope of the above simple linear regression model different from zero?(Perform the hypothesis test on the slope)
7.	Please compare R2 values for the training and test sets and interpret if there is overfitting or not. Even if overfitting exists, please continue your methodology, do not try to resolve it. 
8.	Discuss potential limitations of using house age as the only predictor in the model. What other variables from the dataset might improve the model’s accuracy? Why? 
9.	Consult ChatGPT to obtain the Python code of a multiple linear regression implementation for this data set by considering appropriate variables in the model with R2 values for both training and test sets. Please execute this code to see the results. 
10.	Which model demonstrates better performance in predicting house prices: the simple linear regression model or the multiple linear regression model? Please provide a comparison based on the R2 (and other important evaluation metrics) values for the test sets.
